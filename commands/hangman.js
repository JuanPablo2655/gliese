//How should we do this?
//Like if a user does the hangman command, we need to remember that they are playing hang man, but they might get annoyed if we are like "Please enter a letter" when
//they send an actual msg
//also could be kinda spammy

//you got a point, uhhh nah I think we should be fine without hangman

//yeah, I'll leave the file here incase I think of a way that it could work, but for now I'll skip it.

//okay
